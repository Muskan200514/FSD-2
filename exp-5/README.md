~ Lazy Loading

  * Loads components only when they are required
  * Reduces the initial JavaScript bundle size
  * Improves application load time
  * Uses dynamic imports to fetch components at render time

~ Suspense with Fallback UI

  * Wraps lazy-loaded components
  * Displays a fallback UI (e.g., “Loading…”) while the component is loading
  * Ensures a smooth and better user experience during code fetching
